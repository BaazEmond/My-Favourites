        <h1>My Favourite Things to Do</h1>
    
        <h2>Football</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, Football is an amazing sport.  Some of the reasons are:
            <ul>
                <li>It is a very fun activity</li>
                <li>You can play a variety of positions, depending on your skillset</li>
                <li>You have to work up to the goal of making it to the professional leagues</li>
                <li>The rewarding feeling of accomplishing something big</li>
                <li>The team effort</li>
            </ul>
                <p>Football is a sport that includes many of the aspects of sports that I like.</p>

                <h2>Trainging in the Gym</h2>
                <p>Training in the Gym is a way to get my physical form stronger.  The experience of the gym is all discipline, and having that discipline is something I like.  The experience of the gym with friends is also great, because of the motivation that friends can give you.  Training in the gym is something I need to do to get into some of my other hobbies, so I consider that as a Win-Win.

                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>As a youner person in this society, I enjoy playing video games.  I enjoy playing games that include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minecraft</li>
                    <li>Fortnite</li>
                    <li>MCOC</li>
                </ul>
                    <p>Sometimes, other games will pop up when I am bored, but generally, those three games are the games I play the most.  I prefer playing these games with friends, because of the team aspect of the game, and plus, I prefer to talk to people opposed to being alone.</p>

      <h2>Spending time with my family</h2>
      <p>I enjoy spending time with my family, because I like to reinforce the familial bond in between us.  Without that bond, what are we?  We spend time together by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>taking drives around the city</li>
        <li>Watching TV</li>
        <li>Eating dinner</li>
        <li>Taking walks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I enjoy spending time with my family.  I don't know how to give a link to this one, because family time varies from peerson to person.</p>
